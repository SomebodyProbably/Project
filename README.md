  <h1>Information About This Project I Guess?</h1>
  <h4>I believe that this page is supposed to have a description of the project, so I suppose that this project can be anything personal/relating to me (as listed). So I guess this entire project will center around pineapples, a fruit near and dear to me, and one that I believe should get more attention in the world.</h4>
